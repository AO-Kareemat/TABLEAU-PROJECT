It has been deduced that Alaska has the least means of commute time at about 11 minutes, the location of work could be a factor as we have seen that some states in the least commute time has the highest work from home percentages. These states include, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Alaska etc. These states also have the lowest of populations which contribute to reducing traffic.


Design – I have used the bar charts for my analysis. This is because the chart shows clarity and hierarchy, as we want to determine the best.
